## Game Instructions

This is a classical Arcade Game. To play the game you use the arrow keys to let the figure go up, down, left and right. Try to bring the figure to the water fields without beeing hit by the bugs. Each time you reach the water one additional bug will appear. You win the game by reaching the water tiles three times. You loose if your figure gets hit by a bug the third time.

To play the game you need to download the zip file from github and extract them in the destination folder. Click on the index.html file to open the game in your browser and play.

Good luck!
