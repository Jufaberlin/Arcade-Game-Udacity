## Game Instructions

This is a classical Arcade Game. To play the game you use the arrow keys to make the figure go up, down, left and right. Try to get the figure to the water fields without beeing hit by the bugs. Each time you win one additional bug will appear. You win the game by getting to the water fields the third time. You loos by getting hit by a bug the third time.
After the figure wins or looses the bugs will come to the initial amount of 9 again.

To play the game you need to download the zip file and extract the files in the destination folder. Click on the index.html file to open the game in your browser.

Good luck!
